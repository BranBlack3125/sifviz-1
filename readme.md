# Visualizing Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) by Timeframe and Region

**Group Members:** Lila Leatherman and Bran Black

**Motivation:** Both Lila and Bran have an interest in developing tools capable of expressing change in remotely sensed data over time. The problem of displaying shifts in SIF responses over time is a good representation of both the type of input data and change detection techniques Lila and Bran plan to work with in future research, making this project an excellent case study both students may adapt for future uses.

**Project Description:** We intend to create a tool capable of displaying SIF data by user-selected region over a specified time period. Special focus will be given to providing a means for users to detect changes within SIF over time, such as seasonal shifts in fluorescence or vegetative responses to drought. The shift in SIF values over the prescribed time period will be displayed as a heat map, either as a static map output or as an animation over time. Ideally, we will include various general zonal statistics of the selected area over the designated timeframe (mean, variance, average time series over the location, etc.). This analysis-heavy multi-view will be centered on using different methods of visualizing change over space and time. 

**Data:**

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a relatively new remote sensing index. In contrast to traditional vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI), SIF is connected to the physiology of plant production, rather than the greenness of vegetation. SIF is also more sensitive to intra-annual variation in production related to heat and drought stress. SIF is correlated with the light use efficiency of photosynthesis (LUE; Guanter et al.2014) and with absorbed photosynthetically activeradiation (APAR; Rossini et al. 2010). Thus, SIF provides an ideal proxy for gross primary production (GPP) of an ecosystem.

SIF is measured by the NASA GOME-2 satellite at 0.5 decimal degree spatial resolution. SIF data products cover the globe, and are provided at daily and monthly temporal resolution, from 2002-present. SIF data are uploaded shortly after they are observed, and are available from [NASA](https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/satellite/MetOp/GOME_F/). All of our data will be sourced from this site. For this project, we will use monthly data to minimize processing. A focus of our data visualization will be quantifying and visualizing the impacts of a 2012 drought on North America.

**Interface Design:**

[d3heatmap](https://blog.rstudio.com/2015/06/24/d3heatmap/): a geovizualization package capable of similar to the heatmap and heatmap.2 packages, but with expanded user interaction (zooming, highlighting, etc.).

[Map-with-Latitude-Longitude](http://bl.ocks.org/lokesh005/7640d9b562bf59b561d6) : simpler user interface where data selected by points alone

[contour plot](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4241134): contour plot of data that may be useful in displaying difference in SIF data over time

[Geoplotlib](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305983877_Geoplotlib_a_Python_Toolbox_for_Visualizing_Geographical_Data): A Python toolbox that include the capablity to produce heatmaps

**Interface Sketch:**

Included below is a rough sketch outlining the basic configuration of our data viewer. Included are a locator map (upper left), time slider (center left), an output of the selected monitoring station's SIF value over the prescribed time (below time slider), an option to toggle on the Null Earth/Cantabria style animation [link](https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-142.85,43.42,3000) vs a more traditonal heatmap view (lower left margin), and a reporting area for monitoring site statistics over time (bottom right quadrant).
